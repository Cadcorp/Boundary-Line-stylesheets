# Boundary-Line

These are QML files for Boundary-Line in ESRI Shapefile format for use in QGIS

*They have been designed to work with the data as it is supplied*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](link here) the contents of this repository

**2.**  Copy all the QML stylesheets (those files ending .qml) into the same directory as your Boundary-Line ESRI Shapefile data

**3.**  Load your Boundary-Line data into QGIS and it should appear pre-styled

*Aternatively you can load each style individually through the 'Layer Properties' window within QGIS*

**NOTE:** We have set scale ranges to each layer so you may need to zoom in before the boundaries appear

**4.**  Boundary-Line contains different categories of boundary. They can all be viewed together but we recommend the following layer orders depending on your use of the data:

**Administrative Areas**

**Local Voting Areas**

**Greater London Constituencies**

**Scotland and Wales Constituencies**

**Westminster Constituencies**

**NOTE:** We have set different scale ranges for each layer which are appropriate to the level of boundary and its place in the hierarchy. This means that as you zoom in and out, different boundaries will appear. You can change or remove the scale ranges within the 'Layer Properties' window

Your data should now look similar to this:
